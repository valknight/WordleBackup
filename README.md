A copy of Wordle for a friend, after the announcement it will move to the New York Times

hello! a friend really likes wordle as it is, and doesn't want it to get changed with the NYT  purchase, so here we are.

nothing has been modified apart from VS code demanding to reformat the minified JS file. oops.
